# Supreme-Court-Judgement-Prediction-with-Natural-Language-Processing-Techniques

**Introduction:**

In this project, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to predict the results of US Supreme Court cases. Using a dataset of 3303 Supreme Court cases, I turn the facts of the case into numerical data using TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. I then train and evaluate the accuracy of a Linear SVC (Linear Support Vector Classifier) classification model. My goal is to develop an accurate model and understand how to effectively use NLP techniques.
